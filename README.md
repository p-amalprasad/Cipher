# Cipher
## A simple python project based on encryption/decryption using tkinter library along with mysql database.
Cipher/Cypher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.
This project allows the user to perform encryption or decryption of any text they want to keep protected. This program also ensures that no one except the user can access
any of the text content that is encrypted as it has the feature of access code. Only if the access code is right, the encrypted data would be decrypted correctly.
The user can also save the data to the database for future references.
